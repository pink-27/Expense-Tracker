Here's a sample `README.md` for using the Kubernetes manifests you have in your project directory:

# Kubernetes Manifests for Deployment

This repository contains Kubernetes manifests designed for deploying and scaling a multi-tier application on a Minikube cluster. The deployment includes backend and frontend services, as well as Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) to manage scaling based on traffic.

## Project Structure

```
k8 manifests/
│
├── hpa-backend.yaml
├── hpa-frontend.yaml
└── minikube-deploy.yaml
```

### Files Overview

- **`hpa-backend.yaml`**: Kubernetes manifest for setting up the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for the backend service. The HPA automatically adjusts the number of pods based on the CPU utilization or custom metrics.

- **`hpa-frontend.yaml`**: Kubernetes manifest for the HPA of the frontend service. This helps ensure that the frontend pods scale in response to varying loads, maintaining application performance and availability.

- **`minikube-deploy.yaml`**: The primary deployment manifest that defines the deployments, services, and other configurations needed to run the backend and frontend services on Minikube.

## Prerequisites

1. **Minikube** installed and running on your local machine.
2. **Kubectl** CLI tool configured to interact with your Minikube cluster.

## Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the application using the provided manifests:

### 1. Start Minikube
Ensure that Minikube is running:

```bash
minikube start
```

### 2. Deploy the Application
Apply the `minikube-deploy.yaml` manifest to deploy the backend and frontend services:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8\ manifests/minikube-deploy.yaml
```

### 3. Deploy the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers
Apply the HPAs to scale the backend and frontend services based on demand:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8\ manifests/hpa-backend.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8\ manifests/hpa-frontend.yaml
```

### 4. Verify the Deployment
Check the status of the pods to ensure they are running properly:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Verify that the HPAs are working as expected:

```bash
kubectl get hpa
```

## Accessing the Application

To access the frontend service, use the Minikube service command to open the service in your web browser:

```bash
minikube service frontend-service
```

For other services, you can use `kubectl port-forward` or set up an appropriate `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` configuration based on your cluster settings.

## Cleanup

To delete the deployed resources and clean up your cluster:

```bash
kubectl delete -f k8\ manifests/minikube-deploy.yaml
kubectl delete -f k8\ manifests/hpa-backend.yaml
kubectl delete -f k8\ manifests/hpa-frontend.yaml
```
